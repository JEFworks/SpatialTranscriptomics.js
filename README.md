## Running the App

Youâ€™ll need to have <b>Node</b> and <b>npm</b> installed on your local development machine.

To run the <b>backend server</b> (which runs on port 7000), do the following. You can skip `npm i` if you have already downloaded the packages for the backend. 

```
cd backend
npm i
npm start
```
The server will automatically reload if you make changes to the server (`backend/server.js`).

To run the <b>client-side app</b>, do the following in a separate terminal session. You can skip `npm i` if you have already downloaded the packages for the client-side app.

```
cd client
npm i
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:8000 to view it in the browser. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the client-side code. You will see build errors and lint warnings in the console.
