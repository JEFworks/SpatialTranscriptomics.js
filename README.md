## Running the App

Youâ€™ll need to have <b>Node and npm</b> installed on your local development machine.

To run the <b>client-side app</b>, do the following. You can skip `npm install` if you have already downloaded the packages for the client-side app.

```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the client-side code. You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

You'll also need to run the <b>backend server</b>, which runs on PORT 4000. In a separate terminal session, do the following. You can skip `npm install` if you have already downloaded the packages for the backend.

```
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

If you make changes to the backend code, you will need to restart the backend server for your changes to take effect.
